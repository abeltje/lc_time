liblc_time-perl (0.11) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

    * Signal OpenBSD is not supported.
    
    OpenBSD doesn't support LC_TIME, so no use for CPANTester to look at it.

liblc_time-perl (0.11) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

    * BUGFix: perl-5.21.1 changed POSIX::strftime
    
    POSIX::strftime was changed by 9717af6d049902fc887c412facb2d15e785ef1a4
    to decode the result (%a/%A/%b/%B) if the current locale is UTF-8.
    lc_time::strftime() will still also decode for other encodings like
    ISO8859-*/Big5/KOI8/CP*.
